    This report was generated using a predecessor of <a href="https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId">BugId</a>, a Python
    script created to detect, analyze and id application bugs. Don't waste time manually analyzing issues and writing
    reports but try BugId out yourself today! You'll get even better reports than this one with the current version.
