Exploit
-------
The exploitability of a bad cast depends on many things, including what
properties and methods the real object type and the object type it was cast to
have, how much control an attacker has over the values of properties of the
object, how the code proceeds to use the badly cast object, compiler
optimizations, heap management, etc... Without further investigation it is
impossible to say what an attacker could gain from exploiting this
vulnerability. In this specific case, I did not have time to investigate
exploitability on Google Chrome releases, so I cannot proof this is actually
exploitable.
