Exploit
-------
After getting the feedback from ZDI that helped me understand the root cause,
I attempted to write an exploit that the issue could be controlled and may be
exploitable. I did not keep track of whether my attempts where successful, so
the below code may not actually function. However, it should give you an idea
on how one might go about writing an exploit for this vulnerability.
