In the Proof-of-Concept code provided below, the first exception is triggered
by recursively calling a function with 0x2000 arguments (`N` = 0x2000). The
second exception is triggered by recursively calling a function with 0x200
arguments (`M` = 0x200). The values passed as arguments during the second stack
exhaustion are set to cause the vulnerable pointer to point to a fake vftable
on the heap. The heap is sprayed to create this fake vftable. A fake function
address is stored at 0x28000201 (`pTarget`) that points to a dummy shellcode
consisting of int3's at 0x28000300 (`pShellcode`). Once the vulnerability is
triggered, the vulnerable pointer is used to read the pointer to our shellcode
from our fake vftable and called, which will attempt to execute our shellcode.
