(The fix and CVE number for this issue are unknown)

A specially crafted web-page can trigger a use-after-free vulnerability in
Opera. This vulnerability was found a very long time ago, back when I did not
keep organized records of my analysis, so unfortunately, I cannot speculate on
the potential impact or exploitability.
