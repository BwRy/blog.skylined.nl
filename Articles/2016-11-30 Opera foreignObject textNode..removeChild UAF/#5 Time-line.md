*(I asked ZDI and iDefense if they were interested in Opera vulnerabilities
before submitting them. ZDI responded that they was not, but iDefense
_accidentally_ said they were. After submitting my first vulnerability,
iDefense explained that there had been a mistake on their side and that they
were not in fact interested. However, they kindly offered to buy this
vulnerability for a token reward, which I accepted).*
