The below proof-of-concept consist of a server that hosts a simple web-page.
This web-page uses XMLHttpRequest to make requests to the server. The server
responds with a carefully crafted reply to exploit the vulnerability and leak
data from the main process' memory in the HTTP headers of the response. The
web-page then uses `getAllResponseHeaders()` to read the leaked data, and posts
it to the server, which displays the memory. The PoC makes no attempt to
influence the layout of the main process' memory, so arbitrary data will be
shown and access violation may occur which crash Chrome. With the PoC loaded in
one tab, simply browsing the internet in another might show some leaked
information from the pages you visit.
