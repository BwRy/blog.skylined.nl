Chrome HTTP 1xx base::StringTokenizerT<...>::QuickGetNext OOBR
==============================================================
([CVE-2013-6627][])

[CVE-2013-6627]: http://www.cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-6627

Synopsis
--------
A specially crafted HTTP response can allow a malicious web-page to trigger a
out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Google Chrome. The data is read from the
main process' memory.

Known affected software, attack vectors and potential mitigations
-----------------------------------------------------------------
* **Google Chrome up to, but not including, 31.0.1650.48**

  An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted
  web-page. Disabling JavaScript does not prevent an attacker from triggering
  the vulnerable code path, but may prevent exfiltration of information.
  
  Since the affected code has not been changed since 2009, I assume this
  affects all versions of Chrome released in the last few years.
