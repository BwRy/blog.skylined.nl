The [`HttpStreamParser` class](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_stream_parser.cc)
is used to send HTTP requests and receive HTTP responses. Its `read_buf_`
member is a buffer used to store HTTP response data received from the server.
Parts of the code are written under the assumption that the response currently
being parsed is always stored at the start of this buffer (as returned by
`read_buf_->StartOfBuffer()`), other parts take into account that this may not
be the case (`read_buf_->StartOfBuffer() + read_buf_unused_offset_`). In most
cases, responses are removed from the buffer once they have been parsed and any
superfluous data is moved to the beginning of the buffer, to be treated as part
of the next response. However, the code special cases `HTTP 1xx` replies and
returns a result without removing the request from the buffer. This means that
the response to the next request will not be stored at the start of the buffer,
but after this `HTTP 1xx` response and `read_buf_unused_offset_` should be used
to find where it starts.

The code that special cases HTTP 1xx responses is:
```C++
  if (end_of_header_offset == -1) {
<<<snip>>>
  } else {
    // Note where the headers stop.
    read_buf_unused_offset_ = end_of_header_offset;

    if (response_->headers->response_code() / 100 == 1) {
      // After processing a 1xx response, the caller will ask for the next
      // header, so reset state to support that.  We don't just skip these
      // completely because 1xx codes aren't acceptable when establishing a
      // tunnel.
      io_state_ = STATE_REQUEST_SENT;
      response_header_start_offset_ = -1;
<<<Note: the code above does not remove the HTTP 1xx response from the
         buffer.>>>
    } else {
<<<Note: the code that follows either removes the response from the buffer
         immediately, or expects it to be removed in a call to
         ReadResponseBody later.>>>
<<<snip>>>
  return result;
}
```

A look through the code has revealed one location where this can lead to a
security issue (also in `DoReadHeadersComplete`). The code uses an offset from
the start of the buffer (rather than the start of the current responses) to
pass as an argument to a `DoParseResponseHeaders`. 

```C++
  if (result == ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED) {
<<<snip>>>
    // Parse things as well as we can and let the caller decide what to do.
    int end_offset;
    if (response_header_start_offset_ >= 0) {
      io_state_ = STATE_READ_BODY_COMPLETE;
      end_offset = read_buf_->offset();
<<<Note: "end_offset" is relative to the start of the buffer>>>
    } else {
      io_state_ = STATE_BODY_PENDING;
      end_offset = 0;
<<<Note: "end_offset" is relative to the start of the current response
         i.e. start + read_buf_unused_offset_.>>>
    }
    int rv = DoParseResponseHeaders(end_offset);
<<<snip>>>
```

`DoParseResponseHeaders` passes the argument unchanged to `HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders`:
```C++
int HttpStreamParser::DoParseResponseHeaders(int end_offset) {
  scoped_refptr<HttpResponseHeaders> headers;
  if (response_header_start_offset_ >= 0) {
    headers = new HttpResponseHeaders(HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders(
        read_buf_->StartOfBuffer() + read_buf_unused_offset_, end_offset));
<<<snip>>>
```

The [`HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders` method](https://cs.chromium.org/chromium/src/net/http/http_util.cc)
takes two arguments: a pointer to a buffer, and the length of the buffer. The
pointer is calculated correctly (in `DoParseResponseHeaders`) and points to the
start of the current response. The length is the offset that was calculated
incorrectly in `DoReadHeadersComplete`. If the current response is preceded by
a `HTTP 1xx` response in the buffer, this length is larger than it should be:
the calculated value will be the correct length plus the size of the previous
`HTTP 1xx` response (`read_buf_unused_offset_`).

```C++
std::string HttpUtil::AssembleRawHeaders(const char* input_begin,
                                         int input_len) {
  std::string raw_headers;
  raw_headers.reserve(input_len);

  const char* input_end = input_begin + input_len;
```

+ `input_begin` was calculated as `read_buf_->StartOfBuffer() + read_buf_unused_offset_`,
+ `input_len` was incorrectly calculated as `len(headers) + read_buf_unused_offset_`,
+ `input_end` will be `read_buf_->StartOfBuffer() + 2 * read_buf_unused_offset_ + len(headers)`
+ `input_end` is now beyond the end of the actual headers.
The code will continue to rely on this incorrect value to try to create a copy
of the headers, inadvertently making a copy of data that is not part of this
response and may not even be part of the `read_buf_` buffer. This could cause
the code to copy data from memory that is stored immediately after `read_buf_`
into a string that represents the response headers. This string is passed to
the renderer process that made the request, allowing a web-page inside the
sandbox to read memory from the main process' heap.

An ASCII diagram might be useful to illustrate what is going on:
