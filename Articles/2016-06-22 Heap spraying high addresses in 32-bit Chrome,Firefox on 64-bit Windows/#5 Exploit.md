Exploitation
------------
I've developed a generic way to turn an arbitrary read/write bug into control
over execution flow, which I've named "R + W = E". This works as follows:
1) Use JavaScript to spray the heap with an alternating array of a "target"
   function and a "marker" integer.
2) Use the arbitrary read bug to locate one of the "marker" integers on the
   heap.
3) The "marker" is followed by a pointer to a function structure for the
   "target" function.
4) The "target" function structure contains a pointer to the compiled "target"
   function code in RWE memory.
5) Scan RWE memory or an area that is not currently in use.
6) Write shellcode to unused RWE memory.
7) Read original compiled "target" function code.
8) Overwrite compiled "target" function code with JMP instruction to shellcode.
9) Execute "target" function to run shellcode.
10) Shellcode returns cleanly.
11) Overwrite compiled "target" function code with original code.
12) Restore unused RWE memory where shellcode was stored.
13) WIN!

More details can be found in the in-line documentation of the exploit.
