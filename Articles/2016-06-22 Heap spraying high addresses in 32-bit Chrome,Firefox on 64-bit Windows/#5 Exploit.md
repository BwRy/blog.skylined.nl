Exploitation
------------
I've developed a generic way to turn an arbitrary read/write bug into control
over execution flow, which I've named "R + W = E". This works as follows:
* Use JavaScript to spray the heap with an alternating array of a "target"
  function and a "marker" integer.
* Use the arbitrary read bug to locate one of the "marker" integers on the
  heap.
* The "marker" is followed by a pointer to a function structure for the
  "target" function.
* The "target" function structure contains a pointer to the compiled "target"
  function code in RWE memory.
* Scan RWE memory or an area that is not currently in use.
* Write shellcode to unused RWE memory.
* Read original compiled "target" function code.
* Overwrite compiled "target" function code with JMP instruction to shellcode.
* Execute "target" function to run shellcode.
* Shellcode returns cleanly.
* Overwrite compiled "target" function code with original code.
* Restore unused RWE memory where shellcode was stored.
* ...
* Profit!

More details can be found in the in-line documentation of the exploit.
