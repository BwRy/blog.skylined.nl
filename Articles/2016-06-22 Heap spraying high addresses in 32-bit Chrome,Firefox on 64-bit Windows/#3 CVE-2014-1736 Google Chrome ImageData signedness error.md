CVE-2014-1736 - Chrome on x64 Windows createImageData arbitrary read&write
==========================================================================

At the end of 2013 I found signedness errors and integer overflows in Google
Chrome that allowed reading and writing of arbitrary memory when Chrome is
running on a 64-bit version of Windows. This issue was patched in early 2014,
and I was going to release the details a that time, but there was a small
slipup and the Chrome team forgot to actually apply the patch to the new build.
So, I had to wait a bit longer for it the next release and subsequently
completely forgot to release these details. But that does allow me to bring it
up now and describe how that bug was triggered and how I wrote a
Proof-of-Concept for the issue.

Repro
-----
When using the createImageData of a canvas element to create a very large 
ImageData object on x64 bit versions of Windows, the memory used for this
object can get allocated at address 0x7FFF0000. This causes the mayority of the
object's memory to be located at addresses above 0x7FFFFFFF. This allows
exploitation of signedness errors/integer overflows in the code that handles
reading and writing of pixel data, effectively allowing a script to read and
write memory in the mayority of the process' adddress space.
