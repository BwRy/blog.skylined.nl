Details
-------
By switching the a document's `designMode` property to `on` in a deferred
script, MSIE 9 can be made to reload a web page using
`CMarkup::ReloadInCompatView`. This method calls `CDoc::CompatViewRefresh`,
which indirectly calls `CScriptCollection::~CScriptCollection`, which releases
the `CMarkup` object used as `this` in `CMarkup::ReloadInCompatView`.
The relevant stack for the freeing of this `CMarkup` object is:
```
    76e8c484 kernel32!HeapFree+0x00000014
    6780c4d8 MSHTML!CMarkup::`vector deleting destructor'+0x00000026
    6776fb9b MSHTML!CScriptCollection::~CScriptCollection+0x00000152
    67816a0d MSHTML!CScriptCollection::Release+0x00000053
    6751f7e7 MSHTML!CWindow::SuperNavigateInternal+0x000004c4
    675209f7 MSHTML!CWindow::SuperNavigate2WithBindFlags+0x00000032
    679b05f8 MSHTML!CDoc::CompatViewRefresh+0x000000a0
    679c00d4 MSHTML!CMarkup::ReloadInCompatView+0x0000021f
```
Immediately after returning to `CMarkup::ReloadInCompatView`, the code will use
the (now freed) `CMarkup` object. When page heap is enabled, this lead to an
immediate access violation.

Exploit
-------
I did not immediately find a way to control the freed memory before the reuse
following the `CDoc::CompatViewRefresh` call. I did not immediately find other
locations in the code where the same stale pointer to the `CMarkup` object is
used after it has been freed. It may not be possible to exploit this
use-after-free, as there does not appear to be an easy window of opportunity to
modify the freed memory before its reuse.

However, when loading the repro in MSIE with page heap disabled, I do see
crashes from time to time, but in different locations in the code. This
indicates that one or more of the following should be true:
* There are ways to modify the freed `CMarkup` object before it is reused.
* There are other locations where the freed `CMarkup` object is used after it
  has been freed, and the freed `CMarkup` object can be modified before this
  happens.
* There could be other stale pointers to freed memory that get reused, and
  there are ways to modify the freed memory they point to before that reuse.

As these other crash stacks do not include `CMarkup::ReloadInCompatView`, it
seems most likely that they are caused by the second or third option, which
could indicate that the bug is in fact exploitable.
