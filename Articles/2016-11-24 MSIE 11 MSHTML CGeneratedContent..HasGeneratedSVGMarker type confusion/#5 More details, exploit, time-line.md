DOM Tree
--------
If you replace the `<q>` tag with an `<a>` tag in the repro, or insert a
`<script>` tag before the `<svg>` tag, the repro does not trigger an access
violation. At that point it is possible to use
`document.documentElement.outerHTML` as well as recursively walk
`document.documentElement.childNodes` to get an idea of what the DOM tree looks
like around the time
of the crash.

`document.documentElement.outerHTML`:
```HTML
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <path marker-start="url(&quot;#&quot;)">
        <title>
          <q>
            <button>                    // no closing tag.
            <script>                    // script is a sibling of button
              #text                     // snipped
            </script>
          </q>
        </title>                        // Things get really weird here:
        </title>
      </path>                           // all svg close tags are doubled!?
      </path>
    </svg>                              // Not sure what this means.
    </svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

Walking `document.documentElement.childNodes`:

```HTML
<html>
  <head>
  <body>
    <svg>                               // I did not look at attributes
      <path>                            // ^^^ same here
        <title>
          <q>
            <button>
              <script>                  // script is a child of button
                #text                   // snipped
```

Exploit
-------

I did not find any code path that could lead to exploitation. However, I did
not do a thorough step through of the code to find out if and how I might
control execution flow upwards in the stack. Also, it appears trivial to have
MSIE survive the initial crash by massaging the heap. It might be possible that
other methods are affected by a similar issue and that further DOM
manipulations can be used to trigger a more interesting code path.
