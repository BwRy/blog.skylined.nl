This can cause an access violation at various locations along the code path,
but almost certainly does so if the code reaches the part where it attempts to
match the attribute name, as the `blink::AttributeCollectionGeneric<...>` was
taken from a corrupt `blink::Node` instance and that data is therefore almost
certainly completely invalid.

Exploit
-------
Is is unclear to me why the `blink::Node` instance was corrupted. During
analysis, I was having trouble running Google Chrome with Page Heap enabled,
which severely limited my ability to reliably crash the application and find
out what information on the heap belongs to what object. Then, before I could
get my debugging environment fixed, the issue appears to have been fixed, as
I was no longer able to reproduce it. Any information on exploitability is
therefore based on speculation.

An attacker who is able to trigger the issue reliably, and has some control
over the corrupted `blink::Node` instance that is returned, or heap memory
in this area, may be able to control execution flow through the
`blink::isDisabledFormControl` call, as this uses information from the
corrupted `blink::Node` instance as a pointer to a vftable.
The disassembled code looks like this:

```C++
    blink::isDisabledFormControl:
    push    ebp
    mov     ebp,esp
    mov     ecx,dword ptr [ebp+8]
    mov     eax,dword ptr [ecx+10h]
    shr     eax,3
    test    al,1
    je      label_return_false
    mov     eax,dword ptr [ecx]           // ecx is the corrupted `blink::Node`
    mov     eax,dword ptr [eax+1DCh]      // eax may be attacker controlled
    call    eax                           // eip may be attacker controlled
    test    al,al
    je      chrome_child!blink::isDisabledFormControl+0x22 (5cf71ce2)
    mov     al,1
    pop     ebp
    ret
    label_return_false:
    xor     al,al
    pop     ebp
    ret

Time-line
---------
* *October 2015*: This vulnerability was found through fuzzing.
* *November 2016*: Details of this vulnerability are released.

*(This issue was never reported, as I was struggling with my debugging
environment, as described above. At some point after I discovered it, this
issue appears to have been fixed, as evidenced by the repro no longer working.
However, I have no exact date, nor a fix number to provide here).*
