Exploit
-------
An attacker looking to exploit this issue will commonly attempt to get the
memory allocated to store the PNG image in a location that is followed by a
pre-allocated memory block that contains information the attacker would like to
modify. Using the buffer overflow, the attacker can overwrite this
pre-allocated memory block with attacker controlled data. Depending on the type
of the pre-allocated memory, this could allow the attacker to read or modify
arbitrary information within the process and take control of execution flow.
No attempt was made to create a Proof-of-Concept that shows this level of
control.
