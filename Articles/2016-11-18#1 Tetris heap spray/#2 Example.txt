After allocating 1 byte blocks:

  Address Contents
        0 [1st 1 byte block]
        1 [2nd 1 byte block]
        2 [3rd 1 byte block]
        .....
      N-1 [Nth 1 byte block]

  Total memory usage: N bytes.

After freeing even 1 byte blocks:

  Address Contents
        0 free
        1 [2nd 1 byte block]
        2 free
        .....
      N-1 [Nth 1 byte block]

  Total memory usage: N/2 bytes.

After allocating a 2 byte block:

  Address Contents
        0 free
        1 [2nd 1 byte block]
        2 free
        .....
      N-1 [Nth 1 byte block]
        N [2 byte block]

  Address range for the 2 byte block: [N - N+2]
  Total memory usage: (N/2+2) bytes, or roughly half of a normal heap spray.
